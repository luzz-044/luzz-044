Data:

We reconstructed a retinal disease dataset based on the Messidor database, consists of 1200 eye fundus color numerical images of the posterior pole acquired from three ophthalmologic departments. 
In the reconstructed dataset, six classes were labeled, represented by classes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Class 0 represents the normal images without any lesions; class 1 stands for the images labeled as DR grade 1 and DME grade 0; class 2 indicates the images labeled as DME grade 0 and DR grade 2. Since there are a few images labeled in both DME grade 1 or 2 and DR grade 1 or 2, the images both with DR grade 1 or 2 and DME grade 1 or 2 are regarded as one grade, represented by class 3; class 4 stands for the DR grade 3 and DME grade 0; class 5 signifies the DR grade 3 and DME grade 1 and 2. Table 1 shows the numbers of images in the six classes for our constructed data set. 
Totally, there are 546 images of class 0, 142 images of class 1, 182 images of class 2, 74 images of class 3, 104 images of class 4 and 152 images of class 5.
